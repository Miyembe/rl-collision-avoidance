:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

## Requirement

- python2.7
- [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic)
- [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Stage](http://rtv.github.io/Stage/) --> Use this [instruction](https://github.com/rtv/Stage/blob/master/INSTALL.txt)
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) --> Note that this repo was modifed for non-cuda version.  

## How to train
Git clone this repo into `catkin_ws/src` and do `catkin_make`. 
All the following instructions should be executed at this repo folder (i.e. `src/rl-collision-aovidance`). 

To train Stage1, modify the hyper-parameters in `ppo_stage1.py` as you like, and running the following command:
```
rosrun stage_ros_add_pose_and_crash stageros -g worlds/stage1.world
mpiexec -np 24 python ppo_stage1.py
```
To train Stage2, modify the hyper-parameters in `ppo_stage2.py` as you like, and running the following command:
```
rosrun stage_ros_add_pose_and_crash stageros -g worlds/stage2.world
mpiexec -np 44 python ppo_stage2.py
```
## How to test

```
rosrun stage_ros_add_pose_and_crash stageros worlds/circle.world
mpiexec -np 50 python circle_test.py
```
